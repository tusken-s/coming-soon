              or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically when using this

            <h2>Mode and place of processing the Data</h2>
            <h3>Methods of processing</h3>
            <p>
              The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent
              unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized
              destruction of the Data.<br />The Data processing is carried out
              using computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational
              procedures and modes strictly related to the purposes indicated.
              In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be
              accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with
              the operation of this Application (administration, sales,
              marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such
              as third-party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting
              providers, IT companies, communications agencies) appointed, if
              necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of
              these parties may be requested from the Owner at any time.
            </p>
            <h3>Legal basis of processing</h3>
            <p>
              The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of
              the following applies:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Users have given their consent for one or more specific
                purposes. Note: Under some legislations the Owner may be allowed
                to process Personal Data until the User objects to such
                processing (“opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any
                other of the following legal bases. This, however, does not
                apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to
                European data protection law;
              </li>
              <li>
                provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an
                agreement with the User and/or for any pre-contractual
                obligations thereof;
              </li>
              <li>
                processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation
                to which the Owner is subject;
              </li>
              <li>
                processing is related to a task that is carried out in the
                public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested
                in the Owner;
              </li>
              <li>
                processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate
                interests pursued by the Owner or by a third party.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific
              legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
              whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or
              contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into
              a contract.
            </p>
            <h3>Place</h3>
            <p>
              The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any
              other places where the parties involved in the processing are
              located.<br /><br />
              Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve
              transferring the User's Data to a country other than their own. To
              find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
              Data, Users can check the section containing details about the
              processing of Personal Data.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data
              transfers to a country outside the European Union or to any
              international organization governed by public international law or
              set up by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the
              security measures taken by the Owner to safeguard their Data.<br /><br />
              If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by
              checking the relevant sections of this document or inquire with
              the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.
            </p>
            <h3>Retention time</h3>
            <p>
              Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as
              required by the purpose they have been collected for.
            </p>
            <p>Therefore:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance
                of a contract between the Owner and the User shall be retained
                until such contract has been fully performed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s
                legitimate interests shall be retained as long as needed to
                fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information
                regarding the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within
                the relevant sections of this document or by contacting the
                Owner.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer
              period whenever the User has given consent to such processing, as
              long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may
              be obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever
              required to do so for the performance of a legal obligation or
              upon order of an authority.<br /><br />
              Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted.
              Therefore, the right of access, the right to erasure, the right to
              rectification and the right to data portability cannot be enforced
              after expiration of the retention period.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h2>The purposes of processing</h2>
            <p>
              The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to
              provide its Service, comply with its legal obligations, respond to
              enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those
              of its Users or third parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent
              activity, as well as the following: Access to third-party
              accounts.
            </p>

            <p>

              purpose, the User may refer to the section “Detailed information

              their particular situation to justify the objection.
            </p>
